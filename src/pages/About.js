            Hi! My name is Kat and I'm a computer science major with a history
            minor. Throughout my journey in school, I've found
            that I'm interested in human centered computing
            as well as human computer interaction or UX Design. I discovered
            my UX passion whilst taking an interaction design class abroad
            in Singapore, and had the help of wonderful teachers and TA's guiding
            me along. I hope to pursue a future in the intersection of computer science
            and human behavior.  
            On top of those, I also am interested in the area of machine learning!
        </p>
